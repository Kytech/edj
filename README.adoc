= Fork of Ian Darwin's Edj for Data Structures and Algorithms Final Project

My Data Structures and Algorithms project is meant to give me an opportunity to better explore
data structures as they may be used in real software. I've always found stacks to be interesting,
and I felt that a great example of their use could be in dealing with edit histories, which lead
me to look into writing a text editor since that would likely give me a few more structures to work
with as well.

I came across Ian Darwin's excellent article about building a text editor in Java when I was deciding
on what to do for this project. I found his article to be a great read and I would highly recommend reading 
https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/for-the-fun-of-it-writing-your-own-text-editor-part-1[his series
on building edj] if you are interested in learning more about building a text editor.

I noticed that Ian writes about implementing an undo feature and provides some code that
implements an undo feature. I thought that it would be a bit of an interesting challenge
to reimplement the undo feature in a way that also supports redoing. I decided to make this my
main focus instead of writing an entire editor from scratch for my project. The general idea here involves
dealing with tracking changes through a sort of dual-stack system using an undo and a redo stack, which I
thought could be abstracted into it's own sort of data structure/class as well. Building this dual-stack 
undo/redo structure is the focus of my project.

= edj, sedj, and vedj

Edj (pronounced like the English word "edge") is the skeleton of 
a simple line editor patterned after Unix ed(1).
sedj is the stream editor - a tiny subset of Unix sed(1).
vedj is - wait for it - the visual edj.
The names all rhyme.

It was not created to be a useful editor - _you cannot yet save your work!_ - but to
provide a platform for some demonstrations of Design Patterns and related issues, particularly
in the Java language, including the "undo" command. If someone (or even me) tries to turn
it into a useful line editor, you'll know that CLI fans have regained the
upper hand in geekdom. Or not.

It was also written to show that you can, in fact, do something small and 
(possibly) useful in Java without dragging in 47 different add-on JAR files.
This project has zero external run-time dependencies and only one test-time dependency (JUnit).

Note that the `BufferPrims` code has changed slightly from the version shown
in Part 1 of the article, appearing in the July/August issue of Java
Magazine, due to the need to support a screen editor as well.  If you want
that exact version, use `git checkout edj_article`.

== Usage

* Compile and package:
----
	mvn package
----
* Copy the _edj_ and _vedj_ scripts to a directory on your path 
(for MS-DOS-derived systems, somebody needs to write DOS bat files to do the same thing).
* Copy the JAR file from _target/_ to someplace like $HOME/lib/
* Hack the scripts script to find the jar file there.

Invoke with a filename argument, or, start with an 'r' (read file) command.

Commands are single lower-case letters (or '.' or '=')
Command lines are of the form _start_,_end_++COMMAND++_operands_

The line range _start_,_end_ is optional; if omitted altogether the
current line (most recently added or modified, or clicked on in vedj) is meant.
If only one line is intended, omit the comma and the second number.
A command line that consists only of a line number will move the current line to that number.

The original _ed_'s special line number '$' (dollar sign) meaning 'last line' is not yet implemented.
Line numbers beginning with '+' or '-' are not implemented.
The special filename syntax beginning with '!' ('bang' or exclamation mark) will not be implemented.

The following commands are implemented so far:

[[commands]]
.Implemented Commands
[options="header",cols="2,3,5"]
|====
|Name|Stands for|Notes
|.|Current|Print the current line
|=|Line numbers|What are current and dollar(last-line) equal to?
|a|append|Type lines, end with "." on line by itself
|d|delete|
|e|edit|load a new file and make it the current file
|f|filename|Print or set the current filename
|p|print|Print the line or lines
|q|quit|Does not currently prompt for unsaved changes
|r|read|read named file into buffer
|s|substitute|[linerange]s/old/new/[g][p] - replace old (regex) with new (text), once per line unless g
|u|undo|Undoes last modify command
|====

The following are *not* implemented:

[[unimplemented-commands]]
.Unimplemented Commands
[options="header",cols="2,3,5"]
|====
|Name|Stands for|Notes
|b|-|
|c|change|combines delete with append
|g|global|Not implemented, but g/RE/p is the origin of the grep command's name.
|h|-|
|i|insert|Like 'a' but inserts before current line
|j|join|merge current line and next line into one line
|k|marK|
|l|list|Like p but expands unprintable characters
|m|move|
|n|-|
|o|-|
|t|transfer|Copy lines
|v|inVert|like g but does non-matching lines
|w|write|write to current file if any, or named file
|x|?|encrypt file
|y|-|
|z|-|
|:|extension|That would start down the path from _ed_ to _ex_, and then _vi_. Not on my watch.

== History

When computers were very young, there were no graphics systems for them, no touchscreens, no mice,
only "terminals" that read from a keyboard and printed on paper. It was in this era that line editors
were the dominant way of editing text for program source code, emails, instant messages, and so on.

An _ed_ command that is recognizably the origin of this family of tools appeared in 
Version 1 of AT&T Bell Labs Research UNIX around 1970.

Versions of _ed_ have been in every flavor of Unix (including *BSD and Mac OS X),
and in every Unix-like system (Linux etc.), since then.
Berkeley Unix mutated _ed_ into _ex_, and then added __vi__sual editing mode, which became the
_vi_ editor, in the late 1970's. Vi still has _ex_ (and hence _ed_) line mode editing built in.

So this project is a months-young implementation of a fifty-year-old specification.
